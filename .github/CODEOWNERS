# The CODEOWNERS file is used to define individuals or teams that are
# responsible for code in a repository.

# Code owners are automatically requested for review when someone opens a pull
# request that modifies code that they own.

# Order is important; the last matching pattern takes the most precedence.


# These owners will be the default owners for everything in the repo.
